# Rob's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This guide aims to provide a convenient reference to the key concepts learned during the Front End Bootcamp.  It solves the problem of having to access course materials for those not on the course, and for wading through lengthy course materials for those on the course. By making the guide I was able to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, and how these integrate to make a website.  Making this guide also provided the opportunity to practice GitFlow and understand why it is an important technology for collaborative web development.

## Usage

This guide comprises four sections: HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript, and includes simple notes relating to each web technology.  It also has a suggested starting section (randomly selected) to give readers an interactive nudge when they open the document.  Note that by opening the DevTools console, it is possible to see the Javascript running.
